Many used Euro cars are very cheap and easy to get into for those that would otherwise not be able to buy a new car of the same make.

Let me tell you, if all you want is to see a magazine chock full of awesome V-Twin custom bikes and you don't care what part of the globe they are from or what badge was on the tank then you better slap yourself down for a subscription to V-Twin magazine.<br />While pouring through a recent issue of V-Twin I find numerous four page spreads on fantastic custom cruisers that include a Kawasaki Vulcan 800, a Yamaha Road Star and a Yamaha Royal Star plus pictures of reader's rides showing a Yamaha Road Star and a Suzuki Intruder.  Of course there are your typical custom Harley entrants including a fantastic Knucklehead and an INSANE custom from Eurocomponants!  There are also heaps of ads for vendors that cater to both the Metric and Harley owners which is nice to see.  And of course there are naturally write-ups on product reviews, wrenching advice, bike events, biking editorials and general bike news geared to the cruiser owner.<br />To me this is a great magazine that doesn't try to push the Harley world down my throat and I don't think I found a disparaging comment towards Metric bikes anywhere which was quite refreshing.  V-Twin isn't about bad ... `tudes, nor is it full of half naked women and profanity, it's all about custom cruisers and doesn't attempt to be anything its not.  Don't get me wrong, I love a picture of a half naked woman laid over a bike as much as the next guy, but at the end of the day we are here for the bikes, admit it.

      "{'rating': 4.0, 'title': \"Best car mag I've read - but you pay for it\", 'text': \"I just received my first issue of EVO about a week ago, and I'm impressed.  It does, in my opinion, live up to all the hype.  The writing and photography are excellent.  It's also jam packed with material, as opposed to many US car magazines that are jam packed with advertisements.  The quality of the paper it's printed on is also very high, which I suspect is part of the reason for the high price.<br /><br />As a US reader, one of the only downsides is that I like to see the US$ base and as tested prices of the cars reviewed for a buyer in the US - obviously I can't hold the lack of this information against EVO as it's a UK magazine (pricing information, obviously, is in pounds, but you can't simply convert pounds to US$ because cars are MUCH more expensive over there).  One other drawback is that it doesn't provide a comprehensive table of data for most reviewed cars, as does Car and Driver.  I'll keep my subscription of C&D to provide the 2 pieces of information mentioned in this paragraph, but as far as reading the articles/reviews EVO is a superior publication.<br /><br />One big positive of EVO (and I say this with limited experience as I've only received one issue), but it is focused exclusively on cars an enthusiast would be interested in.  That means you don't have to sift through page after page filled with boring reviews/photos of the Ford 500 and Toyota Camry in order to find one review of a car you're actually interested in reading about.  You also get to read about a number of great cars that can't be purchased in the US, which is both interesting or frustrating.  It truly is an enthusiast magazine in this regard.<br /><br />Based on content alone I'd probably give EVO 5 stars, but I feel like I need to ding them a star simply because of the astronomical price.  I got my subscription as a gift, but I WOULD pay the $160+ price myself if I had to, albeit reluctantly.<br /><br />It did take awhile for me to start receiving the subscription, which was purchased on Amazon in mid-December and I didn't receive the first issue until mid-February.  This is just a minor gripe, though, and I didn't deduct a star for it or anything.<br /><br />In all, if you're into cars, I'd rate EVO Magazine as highly recommended if you can swallow the price.\", 'images': '[]', 'asin': 'B00007AX5U', 'parent_asin': 'B00007AX5U', 'user_id': 'AHF2KMDTMBOJYRXFLY3WA6BLASAQ', 'timestamp': '2007-02-20 17:42:44.000', 'helpful_vote': 2, 'verified_purchase': False, 'average_rating': 3.9, 'rating_number': 25, 'features': '[]', 'description': '[]', 'videos': '[]', 'store': 'Evo Publications', 'categories': \"['Magazine Subscriptions', 'Professional & Educational Journals', 'Professional & Trade', 'Transportation']\", 'details': \"{'Date First Available': 'September 16, 2006'}\", 'processed_text': 'i just received my first issue of evo about a week ago and im impressed  it does in my opinion live up to all the hype  the writing and photography are excellent  its also jam packed with material as opposed to many us car magazines that are jam packed with advertisements  the quality of the paper its printed on is also very high which i suspect is part of the reason for the high pricebr br as a us reader one of the only downsides is that i like to see the us base and as tested prices of the cars reviewed for a buyer in the us  obviously i cant hold the lack of this information against evo as its a uk magazine pricing information obviously is in pounds but you cant simply convert pounds to us because cars are much more expensive over there  one other drawback is that it doesnt provide a comprehensive table of data for most reviewed cars as does car and driver  ill keep my subscription of cd to provide the 2 pieces of information mentioned in this paragraph but as far as reading the articlesreviews evo is a superior publicationbr br one big positive of evo and i say this with limited experience as ive only received one issue but it is focused exclusively on cars an enthusiast would be interested in  that means you dont have to sift through page after page filled with boring reviewsphotos of the ford 500 and toyota camry in order to find one review of a car youre actually interested in reading about  you also get to read about a number of great cars that cant be purchased in the us which is both interesting or frustrating  it truly is an enthusiast magazine in this regardbr br based on content alone id probably give evo 5 stars but i feel like i need to ding them a star simply because of the astronomical price  i got my subscription as a gift but i would pay the 160 price myself if i had to albeit reluctantlybr br it did take awhile for me to start receiving the subscription which was purchased on amazon in middecember and i didnt receive the first issue until midfebruary  this is just a minor gripe though and i didnt deduct a star for it or anythingbr br in all if youre into cars id rate evo magazine as highly recommended if you can swallow the price'}\n",

Let me tell you, if all you want is to see a magazine chock full of awesome V-Twin custom bikes and you don't care what part of the globe they are from or what badge was on the tank then you better slap yourself down for a subscription to V-Twin magazine.<br />While pouring through a recent issue of V-Twin I find numerous four page spreads on fantastic custom cruisers that include a Kawasaki Vulcan 800, a Yamaha Road Star and a Yamaha Royal Star plus pictures of reader's rides showing a Yamaha Road Star and a Suzuki Intruder.  Of course there are your typical custom Harley entrants including a fantastic Knucklehead and an INSANE custom from Eurocomponants!  There are also heaps of ads for vendors that cater to both the Metric and Harley owners which is nice to see.  And of course there are naturally write-ups on product reviews, wrenching advice, bike events, biking editorials and general bike news geared to the cruiser owner.<br />To me this is a great magazine that doesn't try to push the Harley world down my throat and I don't think I found a disparaging comment towards Metric bikes anywhere which was quite refreshing.  V-Twin isn't about bad ... `tudes, nor is it full of half naked women and profanity, it's all about custom cruisers and doesn't attempt to be anything its not.  Don't get me wrong, I love a picture of a half naked woman laid over a bike as much as the next guy, but at the end of the day we are here for the bikes, admit it.

      "{'rating': 4.0, 'title': \"Best car mag I've read - but you pay for it\", 'text': \"I just received my first issue of EVO about a week ago, and I'm impressed.  It does, in my opinion, live up to all the hype.  The writing and photography are excellent.  It's also jam packed with material, as opposed to many US car magazines that are jam packed with advertisements.  The quality of the paper it's printed on is also very high, which I suspect is part of the reason for the high price.<br /><br />As a US reader, one of the only downsides is that I like to see the US$ base and as tested prices of the cars reviewed for a buyer in the US - obviously I can't hold the lack of this information against EVO as it's a UK magazine (pricing information, obviously, is in pounds, but you can't simply convert pounds to US$ because cars are MUCH more expensive over there).  One other drawback is that it doesn't provide a comprehensive table of data for most reviewed cars, as does Car and Driver.  I'll keep my subscription of C&D to provide the 2 pieces of information mentioned in this paragraph, but as far as reading the articles/reviews EVO is a superior publication.<br /><br />One big positive of EVO (and I say this with limited experience as I've only received one issue), but it is focused exclusively on cars an enthusiast would be interested in.  That means you don't have to sift through page after page filled with boring reviews/photos of the Ford 500 and Toyota Camry in order to find one review of a car you're actually interested in reading about.  You also get to read about a number of great cars that can't be purchased in the US, which is both interesting or frustrating.  It truly is an enthusiast magazine in this regard.<br /><br />Based on content alone I'd probably give EVO 5 stars, but I feel like I need to ding them a star simply because of the astronomical price.  I got my subscription as a gift, but I WOULD pay the $160+ price myself if I had to, albeit reluctantly.<br /><br />It did take awhile for me to start receiving the subscription, which was purchased on Amazon in mid-December and I didn't receive the first issue until mid-February.  This is just a minor gripe, though, and I didn't deduct a star for it or anything.<br /><br />In all, if you're into cars, I'd rate EVO Magazine as highly recommended if you can swallow the price.\", 'images': '[]', 'asin': 'B00007AX5U', 'parent_asin': 'B00007AX5U', 'user_id': 'AHF2KMDTMBOJYRXFLY3WA6BLASAQ', 'timestamp': '2007-02-20 17:42:44.000', 'helpful_vote': 2, 'verified_purchase': False, 'average_rating': 3.9, 'rating_number': 25, 'features': '[]', 'description': '[]', 'videos': '[]', 'store': 'Evo Publications', 'categories': \"['Magazine Subscriptions', 'Professional & Educational Journals', 'Professional & Trade', 'Transportation']\", 'details': \"{'Date First Available': 'September 16, 2006'}\", 'processed_text': 'i just received my first issue of evo about a week ago and im impressed  it does in my opinion live up to all the hype  the writing and photography are excellent  its also jam packed with material as opposed to many us car magazines that are jam packed with advertisements  the quality of the paper its printed on is also very high which i suspect is part of the reason for the high pricebr br as a us reader one of the only downsides is that i like to see the us base and as tested prices of the cars reviewed for a buyer in the us  obviously i cant hold the lack of this information against evo as its a uk magazine pricing information obviously is in pounds but you cant simply convert pounds to us because cars are much more expensive over there  one other drawback is that it doesnt provide a comprehensive table of data for most reviewed cars as does car and driver  ill keep my subscription of cd to provide the 2 pieces of information mentioned in this paragraph but as far as reading the articlesreviews evo is a superior publicationbr br one big positive of evo and i say this with limited experience as ive only received one issue but it is focused exclusively on cars an enthusiast would be interested in  that means you dont have to sift through page after page filled with boring reviewsphotos of the ford 500 and toyota camry in order to find one review of a car youre actually interested in reading about  you also get to read about a number of great cars that cant be purchased in the us which is both interesting or frustrating  it truly is an enthusiast magazine in this regardbr br based on content alone id probably give evo 5 stars but i feel like i need to ding them a star simply because of the astronomical price  i got my subscription as a gift but i would pay the 160 price myself if i had to albeit reluctantlybr br it did take awhile for me to start receiving the subscription which was purchased on amazon in middecember and i didnt receive the first issue until midfebruary  this is just a minor gripe though and i didnt deduct a star for it or anythingbr br in all if youre into cars id rate evo magazine as highly recommended if you can swallow the price'}\n",

No one can match evo's articles, stories, comparisons, special cover stories (such as Performance Car of the Year and Trackday Car of the Year), photography that no one else can match, and everything else you'd want from an automotive magazine. In short, evo magazine is brilliant. My only complaints is that their acceleration times are almost always about 1/2 second off (which is an extremely small problem, a problem that is forgiven by everything else that is given in this magazine) and a price tag that is higher than any other I've seen. Buying from America, I spend about $10 per issue, but let me tell you, it's worth it. No doubt evo is the best automotive magazine out there, and it is worth the money.

Half of the magazine beyond that is dedicated to industry news and \"sneak peeks.\" These days, that service is better provided online. What a magazine can offer is solid editorial content, comprehensive reviews, and possibly even a sense of community. The editorial content has improved somewhat with the addition of Keith Code\\'s articles. Motorcyclist\\'s reviews of motorcycles have been shoddy in the last few years, the gear reviews sound like an advertisement. And the sense of community, which would be accomplished through a solid online presence, falls short as well.<br /><br />I\\'ll pay more for Cycle World - they have great editorials, experts on staff, and a good website. I\\'ll pay even more for Motorcycle Consumer News - their reviews pull no punches and they provide fantastic info-sheets for each bike reviewed. I\\'ll even pay for Hellforleathermagazine.com\\'s subscription - they get the latest information before anyone else and have an invaluable user base.

After reading an Evo mag a few years ago, I've never looked at any other car magazine the same (or any magazine publication, really).  Its common for an article to stretch 6 - 8 pages filled with paragraph after paragraph of high quality journalism, and killer photography.  These are coffee table pieces for me, and non-car friends find themselves drawn in due to photography and sheer elegance and beauty of these cars captured only in a way that Evo can.  Oh, and the collector edition (aka subscriber) versions of the magazine covers are usually works of art in themselves.  Bravo, Evo.<br /><br />I just renewed for my 2nd year via Amazon.  I will comment that the ship times vary wildly - sometimes I might not receive a magazine for six or more weeks, and then suddenly two will arrive back to back.  But this magazine is coming from England guys... and to keep costs down, I'm sure its sent via the cheapest postage and sits on some cargo ship for weeks crossing the pond, then goes through docking/customs/offloading/delivery... etc.  Its well worth the wait and actually increases my anticipation for each issue.

This, despite not being very interesting. Their mantra has been \"No boring cars!,\" yet it\\'s usually a somewhat boring magazine.<br /><br />They have some really great (and funny) editorials, and tend to be more honestly critical of cars than other mags, so for that they get 2 stars.

I\\'ve been reading several since roughly 1991 (Car, Performance Car, Evo, Performance Car (Part 2), Complete Car, BBC Top Gear and some more short-lived tryouts I can\\'t recall), although I\\'ve trimmed that down to Car and Evo now.  Automobile falls so short any comparison is folly.<br /><br />Space is a major issue (oh lord, I\\'ve gone and made a pun).  Automobile is the smallest of major U.S. car magazines.  It feels just terribly thin in your hands.

If I was interested in where they ate, how nice their hotel carpets were, and sundry other details about absolutely everything BUT the car they happen to be driving, I might renew.  But enough is enough.<br /><br />They had their moments, but are the Saab of car magazines.  And for those who don\\'t know, the news this morning announced that Saab has finally died for good.

      "{'rating': 5.0, 'title': 'Simply the best car magazine', 'text': \"If you're here in the U.S., don't let that put you off reading this fantastic magazine just because you won't see a lot of American cars.  This magazine is worth every cent (more on that later).  And reading of the miriad great cars, from cheap thrills to supercars, that you can't get here will bring tears to your eyes.  Renault making a giant killer little Chevy Aveo-sized hatchback with 197 horsepower and 18-inch wheels?  Yes, it happens over there.<br /><br />It is simply SO much more than you see in any U.S. car mag.  It's BIG, both physically and in content, and written with the kind of thorough evaluation and engrossing, you'd-swear-you-were-right-there-with-them prose above any other (including CAR, my pervious favorite).<br /><br />What makes it so good?  Three main things.  First, the writers, of course, many of them springing from the former Performance Car magazine.  That sad publication declined in just about every way over it's lifetime until, at the time of it's demise, it wasn't worth the bother anymore.  Oh, how they've redeamed themselves!<br /><br />Second, the cars they write about.  The focus is on performance; but not just super-exotics and, thank God, tuner cars (although the latter pop up now and then in an entirely appropriate way), but anything that stirs the driver's soul, even if it's a $10,000 little hatch with a zingy engine and giddy handling.<br /><br />Third, the writing.  EVO is much more biased toward subjective evaluation in favor of just spouting instrument test numbers (hello U.S. car magazines with pages and pages of minute and often uninteresting stats), and their data panels are concise and have just enough information to be thorough without a bunch of fluff (brake swept area?  Come on, Road and Track, who cares?).<br /><br />The best example by far is their annual car of the year issue.  Yes, everyone does these, but no one does it like EVO.  It's much more free-form, much more subjective, and much, much more fun to read.  Rather than evaluate each car in a distinct portion, it reads more like a road adventure with drivers swapping cars and really letting you know how each is to drive.<br /><br />Frankly, you get the impression that EVO doesn't give a squat if one car pulls .89g on a skidpad while a competitor pulls .87g.  What you're much more likely to read is how each car *feels* when that grip is being used, and used to the limit.  Hard numbers matter less than true driving fun, which is why you might find the handling of a little hatchback rated above a wide tired monster's.<br /><br />They do provide plenty of performance data, but the big difference is they don't get caught up in it.  You'll find it's more important how a car handles than how it grips, how effective it's brakes are over a long, hard drive rather than how many feet it takes to do a single stop, and how the car works with or against you to provide real fun.  All done with engaging writing and wit.<br /><br />I'll stop babbling now.  :o)  But I do want to conclude with one item mentioned in almost every review here - price.  It's cheaper to buy at a good bookstore.  There is some convenience and peace of mind in having a subscription, but I'm baffled as to why British car mags are always more expensive to subscribe to than to buy off the shelf.

Davis left several years ago - he\\'s in his 70\\'s so he\\'s entitled to slow down - and left the editorship to Ms. Jean Lindamood Jennings, also formerly of Car & Driver.

Jennings colum returned to it\\'s traditional place on the back page.  She is charming, sharp-witted, and just a share irreverant.  Like I said, brilliant.  Other notables include the incomparable Jamie Kitman and the newly discovered Ezra Dyer.  Both write with a candor unmatched by any other automobile publication.<br /><br />The downside: the magazine is a bit thin.

      "{'rating': 5.0, 'title': 'Do not Waste, Make Haste, this is the Car Magazine for you!', 'text': 'Jethro Bovingdon.  Richard Meaden.  Harry Metcalfe.  Who are these men?  Has it ever been important, even plausible that the reader would desire to not only know the names of, but get to know an automobile journalist?  These exceptional men are not just magazine editors (Although Harry, and now Jethro, do hold that title), but the guys out there in the trenches putting the rubber to pavement, driving some the world\\'s best vehicles to 9/10ths and telling you the absolute truth about their performance, handling, and day to day livability.<br /><br />The MotorTrend so called \"Car of the Year\"?  Fuggedabouit!<br /><br />The EVO \"Car of the Year\" actually requires someone to have driven the car before handing it an award.  To have driven it HARD.<br /><br />I started reading EVO a little over 3 years ago.  To be honest, at the time the initial appeal was the larger form factor (larger than any U.S. car magazine) and breathtaking full-page photography.  However, it only took a short while to realize I was holding in my hand the gold-standard for automotive journalism.  The on road and on track reviews in each issue,  the hard-hitting interviews with the newsmakers, designers and industry leaders that are responsible for the direction of automotive performance, and the unique British sensibility and the pleasure of seeing a $500,000 supercar struggle on a classic B-road, put them together and you have the best English-language car magazine published in the world today.<br /><br />I remember one time expressing to a female friend how EVO posseses not only incredible technical acumen--some of the most accurate road tests in the business--but nearly every issue embodies some of the finest prose put to page in _any_ monthly journal.  It just so happend in that months issue there was a  particularly moving passage from Harry Metcalfe on a group of Ferrari\\'s that were being road tested.  The beauty of Mr. Metcalfe\\'s evocative language could bring a tear to any car lover\\'s--even a grown man\\'s--eye.  With such automotive passion, is it any wonder that Sir Harry went on to own a 512TR himself?  And how many auto journalist live with (and pay for!) the exotic cars they test and so readily praise?<br /><br />Every month this magazine covers the creme of performance oriented automobiles, many of which are only available in Europe or the UK.  From the Renault Megane to the Pagani Zonda, EVO will give an accurate, thorough review of it\\'s performance in both on track and real world driving conditions.  Due to their location in Europe, and their extensive connections throughout the car world, EVO often travels to Australia or even Africa to see some of the best sedans, coupes, convertibles and exotics in their native or not so native environment.
